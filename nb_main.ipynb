AI involves the development of algorithms and computer programs that can learn from data, make decisions, and solve problems without explicit instructions from a human. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. AI has applications in various industries, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. Its goal is to create machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, understanding language, and making decisions.\n"
